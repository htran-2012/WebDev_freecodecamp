        <p<>The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald 
            in the fictional towns of West Egg 
            and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily 
            concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion 
            and obsession with the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan.</p>

        <p>The novel explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, 
            social upheaval and excess, creating a portrait of the Roaring Twenties 
            that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.</p>

        <h3>Historical context</h3>

        <p>Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby provides 
            a critical social history of Prohibition-era America during the Jazz Age.
            That period isknown for its jazz music, economic prosperity, flapper culture,
            libertine mores, rebellious youth, and ubiquitous speakeasies.</p>

        <p>In Fitzgerald's eyes, the 1920s era represented a morally permissive time 
            when Americans of all ages became disillusioned with prevailing social norms and 
            were monomaniacally obsessed with self-gratification.</p>

        <h3>Plot summary</h3>

        <p>Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 
            to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, 
            a wealthy area populated by the new rich, 
            a group who have made their fortunes too recently
            and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. 
            Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, 
            who throws extravagant parties in his mansion every Saturday night.</p>

        <p>Nick drives out to East Egg one evening 
            for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, 
            an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, 
            a beautiful young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. 
            Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: 
            Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, 
            who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground 
            between West Egg and New York City. 
            Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle.
            At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, 
            Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.</p>
        
        <p>As the summer progresses, Nick eventually garners an invitation 
            to one of Gatsby’s legendary parties. He encounters Jordan Baker at the party, 
            and they meet Gatsby himself, a surprisingly young man who affects an English accent, 
            has a remarkable smile, and calls everyone “old sport.” 
            Gatsby tells Jordan that he knew Daisy in Louisville in 1917 and is deeply in love with her. 
            He spends many nights staring at the green light at the end of her dock, 
            across the bay from his mansion. Gatsby’s extravagant lifestyle and wild parties 
            are simply an attempt to impress Daisy. 
            Gatsby now wants Nick to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy, 
            but he is afraid that Daisy will refuse. 
            Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house, without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. 
            After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy reestablish their connection. 
            Their love rekindled, they begin an affair.
        </p>

        <p>After a short time, Tom discovers the affair when Daisy carelessly addresses Gatsby 
            with unabashed intimacy in front of him at a luncheon at the Buchanans’ house.
            Tom is deeply outraged and forces the group to drive into New York City, 
            where he confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel. 
            Tom asserts that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand, 
            and he announces that Gatsby is a criminal—his fortune 
            comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. 
            Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, 
            and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, 
            attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt him.
        </p>
        <p>While returning to East Egg, Gatsby and Daisy drive by Wilson's garage 
            and their car accidentally strikes Tom's mistress, Myrtle, 
            killing her instantly. Gatsby reveals to Nick that it was Daisy 
            who was driving the car, but that he intends to take blame to protect her. 
            Nick urges Gatsby to flee but he refuses. 
            After Tom tells George that Gatsby owns the car that struck Myrtle, 
            a distraught George assumes the owner of the vehicle must be Myrtle's lover. 
            George fatally shoots Gatsby in his mansion's swimming pool and then commits suicide.
        </p>
        <p>Nick stages a small funeral for Gatsby, ends his relationship with Jordan, 
            and moves back to the Midwest to escape the disgust he feels 
            for the people surrounding Gatsby’s life and for the emptiness and moral decay of life 
            among the wealthy on the East Coast. Nick reflects that 
            just as Gatsby’s dream of Daisy was corrupted by money and dishonesty, 
            the American dream of happiness and individualism has disintegrated into the mere pursuit of wealth. 
            Though Gatsby’s power to transform his dreams into reality is what makes him “great,” 
            Nick reflects that the era of dreaming—both Gatsby’s dream and the American dream—is over.

        <h3>Themes analysis</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p id="li-title">The Decline of the American Dream in the 1920s</p>
                <p>Fitzgerald portrays the 1920s as an era of decayed social and moral values, 
                    evidenced in its overarching cynicism, greed, and empty pursuit of pleasure.
                    The unrestrained desire for money and pleasure surpassed more noble goals.</p>
                <p>When World War I ended in 1918, the generation of young Americans 
                    who had fought the war became intensely disillusioned, 
                    as the brutal carnage that they had just faced 
                    made the Victorian social morality of early-twentieth-century America 
                    seem like stuffy, empty hypocrisy. 
                    The dizzying rise of the stock market in the aftermath of the war 
                    led to a sudden, sustained increase in the national wealth 
                    and a newfound materialism, as people began to spend and consume 
                    at unprecedented levels. A person from any social background could, 
                    potentially, make a fortune, but the American aristocracy—families 
                    with old wealth—scorned the newly rich industrialists and speculators. 
                    Additionally, the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919, 
                    which banned the sale of alcohol, created a thriving underworld 
                    designed to satisfy the massive demand for bootleg liquor.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="li-title">The Hollowness of the Upper Class</p>
                <p>In the novel, West Egg and its denizens represent the newly rich, 
                    while East Egg and its denizens, especially Daisy and Tom, 
                    represent the old aristocracy. 
                    Fitzgerald portrays the newly rich as being vulgar, gaudy, 
                    ostentatious, and lacking in social graces and taste. 
                    In contrast, the old aristocracy possesses grace, 
                    taste, subtlety, and elegance.
                <p>What the old aristocracy possesses in taste, however, 
                    it seems to lack in heart, as the East Eggers prove themselves careless, 
                    inconsiderate bullies who are so used to money’s ability 
                    to ease their minds that they never worry about hurting others. 
                    The Buchanans exemplify this stereotype when, 
                    at the end of the novel, they simply move to a new house far away 
                    rather than condescend to attend Gatsby’s funeral. 
                    Gatsby, on the other hand, whose recent wealth 
                    derives from criminal activity, has a sincere and loyal heart, 
                    remaining outside Daisy’s window simply 
                    to make sure that Tom does not hurt her. 
                    Ironically, Gatsby’s good qualities (loyalty and love) 
                    lead to his death, as he takes the blame for killing Myrtle 
                    rather than letting Daisy be punished, 
                    and the Buchanans’ bad qualities (fickleness and selfishness) 
                    allow them to remove themselves from the tragedy 
                    not only physically but psychologically.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="li-title">Class</p>
                <p>In the monied world of The Great Gatsby, 
                    class influences all aspects of life, and especially love. 
                    Myrtle mentions this with regard to her husband, George, 
                    whom she mistook for someone of better “breeding” 
                    and hence greater prospects.
                    Similarly, Gatsby’s pursuit of Daisy is bound up with class. 
                    Only after amassing a large fortune does he feel able to make his move. 
                    At the end of the book, class dynamics dictate which marriage survives 
                    (Tom and Daisy), which one is destroyed (George and Myrtle), 
                    and which one will never come to be (Gatsby and Daisy). 
                    Only the most affluent couple pulls through the events 
                    that conclude the book. 
                    In fact, it seems that the accident may have brought them closer.
                    Because of their elite class status, 
                    Tom and Daisy share a belief that 
                    they are immune to the consequences of their actions.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p id="li-title">Love and Marriage</p>
                <p>The ideals of love and marriage are profoundly strained 
                    in The Great Gatsby, a book that centers on two loveless marriages: 
                    the union between Tom and Daisy Buchanan 
                    and between George and Myrtle Wilson. 
                    In both cases, the marriages seem to be unions of convenience 
                    or advantage than actual love. 
                    Myrtle explains that she married George 
                    because she thought he was “a gentleman,” 
                    suggesting she hoped he’d raise her class status. 
                    Daisy nearly backed out of her marriage to Tom 
                    the day before her wedding, and Tom had an affair 
                    within a year of the wedding, but the couple is well-suited 
                    because of their shared class and desire for fun 
                    and material possessions. Even Gatsby’s all-consuming passion 
                    for Daisy seems more of a desire to possess something unattainable 
                    than actual love. Nick, meanwhile, dates Jordan Baker 
                    throughout the book, and though their relationship 
                    has its moments of warmth and kindness, 
                    both parties generally seem lukewarm and emotionally distant. 
                    “I wasn’t actually in love,” Nick recalls, 
                    “but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.” </p>
